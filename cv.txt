Hello!!
My name is Dmitry Ziablitsev , I'm 19 years old.
Currently I'm the student of BSUIR , 3rd course.
I plan to become a Java Developer.
I really didn't do well with programming when I've just started it.
It has been a loooong way from my first "Hello world !!!" in Java to my today's abilities.
But still I consider myself to be newbie in programming and I really wish to strengthen my coding skills and learn new technologies.
I look forward to hearing from you.
